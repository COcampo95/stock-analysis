# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This project was to refract the Microsoft VBA coding for Steve's parents' annual stock performance from 2017 and 2018 to determine which environmental energy resource stocks are worth investing in. 

### Results 

#### VBACode
Before altering the code, I copied the existing code from the previous macros when calculating the yearValueAnalysis and altered the code to the specifications for this project. Below is the refracted code:

####Stock Performances 
Comparing 2017 and 2018, EMP and RUN continue to perform well in the market. Although they do not yield as high of a return, they continue to do well in a market that saw all other stocks drop in performance.

### Summary

####Pros and Cons of Refactoring code

The advantages of refactoring code are the is the code is more organized and cleaner. Refactoring the code decreased the macro run time; prior to the changes, the code took about 1 second to run.

The disadvantage to refactoring is if the application is too large to take the proper time to alter the code and run proper testing.
